## Data

Database: `/data/` (main file: `/data/matches.json`)

### General rules

- Historical data only
- No editorials (just short notes, photos and video links)

### Specific rules

- Final score: FT or AET (if aet or pen)
- Result: score (+ pen), eg. if score is 2-2 p. 5-4, then first team marked as winner (W) <sup>\*</sup>

<sup>\*</sup> - this might be reviewed soon as per statistical convention in football,
matches decided in extra time should be counted as wins and losses,
while matches decided by penalty shoot-out should be counted as draws
